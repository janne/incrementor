Increments the last number in the URL of the current page. This is useful when
visiting a row of numbered pages. The plus icon only shows up for relevant
pages.

Say you're reading blog post:
http://www.osnews.com/story/222/

By clicking on the plus you go to page:
http://www.osnews.com/story/223/

It also respects any adresses with zero padded numbers. Say you're reading the
page:
http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-009.html

By clicking on the plus you go to page:
http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html

### Keyboard Shortcuts

You may use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Alt-Right instead of clicking the plus
and Ctrl-Alt-Left to decrease the number.

### Advanced tip

In the options page it's possible to change the regexp of the number that is
incremented. By changing it to "\d+" the first number instead of the last is
incremented. It's also possible to set the number of steps that the number is
incremented.
